# Multiple-Regression
This repository contains code for multiple regression analysis in Python.

## Introduction
Multiple regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and two or more independent variables. It is often used in predictive modeling to determine how much of the variation in the dependent variable can be explained by the independent variables.

This repository contains Python code for multiple regression analysis, including data preparation, model fitting, and model evaluation.

## Getting Started
To use this code, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer, as well as the required Python packages listed in requirements.txt. To install these packages, run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Next, clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multiple-regression.git
```
Finally, navigate to the src directory and run the Python scripts:

```
cd multiple-regression/src
python data_preparation.py
python model_fitting.py
python model_evaluation.py
```

## Example Datasets
The data/ directory contains example datasets for multiple regression analysis. These datasets are in CSV format and contain the following columns:

y: The dependent variable.
x1: The first independent variable.
x2: The second independent variable.
x3: The third independent variable.
x4: The fourth independent variable.
